The idea came from Game of Thrones—why not have a messaging app where you can send a message that would only reach your friend in the amount of time it would take a raven (or another type of bird) to fly the distance between you and your friend’s location? The app was a learning experience and involved using: all types of View Controllers, Multiple Storyboards, Auto Layout, Parse backend, MapKit, CoreLocation, UIImagePicker, AFNetworking + the Facebook API,  and Geolocation Services, among other features.
